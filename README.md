# anniversary-project-
Project I made that takes in my messages sent to my girlfriend and returns interesting statistics, such as the total word count. Also allows for searching through messages. This program is built for discord, and as such uses their filing system.
You can replace her IDs with your own, should you wish to use this for your own purposes.
